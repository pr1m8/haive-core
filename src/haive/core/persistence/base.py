"""Base classes and interfaces for the Haive persistence system.

This module defines the core abstractions and interfaces for the persistence
system used throughout the Haive framework. It provides the foundation for
various persistence implementations, ensuring a consistent interface regardless
of the underlying storage technology.

The central component is the CheckpointerConfig abstract base class, which
defines the configuration interface that all persistence providers must implement.
This allows different storage backends to be used interchangeably while providing
a unified API for state persistence.

    This abstract base class defines the interface for all checkpointer
    configurations in the Haive framework. It provides a standardized way
    to configure and create checkpointer instances, regardless of the underlying
    storage technology.

    The CheckpointerConfig class is generic over the connection type T, allowing
    different implementations to use appropriate connection objects (e.g.,
    connection pools for databases, client objects for cloud services).

    All concrete implementations must provide methods for creating both synchronous
    and asynchronous checkpointer instances, ensuring compatibility with both
    programming models.

    Attributes:
        type: The type of checkpointer (e.g., memory, postgres, sqlite)
        mode: Operational mode - synchronous or asynchronous
        storage_mode: Storage mode - full history or just the latest state
