"""In-memory persistence implementation for the Haive framework.

This module provides an in-memory checkpointer implementation that stores state data
temporarily in memory. It's primarily intended for development, testing, and
demonstration purposes where persistence across application restarts is not required.

The memory checkpointer is the simplest implementation, requiring no external
dependencies or infrastructure. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous operation
modes, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases where temporary state management
is sufficient.

    """Configuration for in-memory checkpoint persistence.

    This implementation provides a simple non-persistent memory-based
    checkpointer suitable for development, testing, and demonstration purposes.
    It stores all state data in memory, which means that state is lost when
    the application is restarted.

    The memory checkpointer is the simplest and most lightweight option,
    requiring no external dependencies, connection setup, or infrastructure.
    It's ideal for:

    - Development environments
    - Testing scenarios
    - Quick prototyping
    - Demonstration purposes
    - Stateless applications that don't need persistence

    It supports both synchronous and asynchronous operation modes, with
    the same underlying implementation since the memory checkpointer is
    inherently thread-safe.

    Example:
        ```python
        from haive.core.persistence import MemoryCheckpointerConfig

        # Create a basic memory checkpointer
        config = MemoryCheckpointerConfig()
        checkpointer = config.create_checkpointer()
