"""SQLite-based persistence implementation for the Haive framework.

This module provides a SQLite-backed checkpoint persistence implementation that
stores state data in a local SQLite database file. This allows for durable state
persistence without requiring external database services, making it ideal for
local development, testing, and single-instance deployments.

The SQLite implementation strikes a balance between the simplicity of in-memory
storage and the durability of full database solutions like PostgreSQL. It offers
file-based persistence with minimal setup, while still providing basic thread
tracking and checkpoint management capabilities.

Key advantages of the SQLite implementation include:
- No external dependencies beyond the Python standard library
- Simple file-based storage requiring no separate database service
- Compatibility with both synchronous and asynchronous operations
- Support for both full history and shallow (latest-only) storage modes
- Automatic schema creation and management

class SQLiteSaver:
    """A LangGraph-compatible checkpointer implementation using SQLite.

    This class provides a simple but effective implementation of the LangGraph
    checkpointer interface using SQLite as the storage backend. It handles state
    persistence, thread tracking, and checkpoint management through a local
    SQLite database file.

    The implementation automatically creates and manages the necessary database
    schema, including tables for threads and checkpoints. It provides methods
    for storing and retrieving checkpoint data, managing thread information,
    and tracking checkpoint relationships.

    Key features include:

    - File-based persistence with minimal setup requirements
    - Support for tracking parent-child relationships between checkpoints
    - Thread management with metadata and activity tracking
    - Automatic schema creation and database directory management
    - Efficient storage and retrieval of checkpoint data
    - JSON serialization for flexible data storage

    This implementation is ideal for local development, testing, and single-instance
    deployments where a full database service like PostgreSQL would be overkill.

    - Thread registration and tracking with metadata
