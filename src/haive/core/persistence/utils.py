"""Utility functions for the Haive persistence system.

This module provides helper functions for working with checkpointers and their
associated resources. It includes utilities for connection pool management,
serialization/deserialization of metadata, and other common operations needed
across different persistence implementations.

The utilities are designed to be used by the persistence system internals and
generally aren't intended to be used directly by application code. They provide
consistent behavior across different checkpointer implementations and handle
edge cases and error conditions gracefully.
