"""Type definitions for the Haive persistence system.

This module provides enumeration types and utility classes for the persistence system,
defining the available checkpointer types, operational modes, and storage strategies.
These types are used throughout the persistence system for configuration and operation.

The module includes special handling for Python keyword conflicts (like 'async') and
backward compatibility mappings for evolving terminology.
