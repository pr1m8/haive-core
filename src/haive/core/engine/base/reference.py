"""
Component reference implementation for the Haive engine system.

This module provides a reference mechanism that allows components to be referenced
by their ID, name, or type, and resolved at runtime. This enables lazy loading,
serialization of references, and dynamic resolution of components.

    Reference to a component that can be resolved at runtime.

    This class provides a way to reference components (engines, tools, etc.) without

    when needed, enabling serialization, lazy loading, and runtime configuration.

    Attributes:
        id (Optional[str]): Unique identifier of the referenced component.
        name (Optional[str]): Name of the referenced component.
        type (Optional[Union[str, EngineType]]): Type of the referenced component.
        config_overrides (Dict[str, Any]): Configuration overrides to apply when resolving.
        extensions (List[Dict[str, Any]]): Extensions to apply to the component.
        _resolved (Optional[T]): Private cache for the resolved component instance.
