"""Agent Schema Composer for the Haive Framework.

This module provides the AgentSchemaComposer class, which extends SchemaComposer
with agent-specific functionality for building dynamic state schemas from multiple
agents. It handles intelligent field separation, message preservation, and
multi-agent coordination patterns.

The AgentSchemaComposer is the cornerstone of multi-agent state management in Haive,
enabling seamless composition of schemas with proper field sharing, reducers, and
engine I/O mappings while preserving critical message fields like tool_call_id.

Example:
    Basic usage for composing schemas from agents::

        from haive.core.schema.agent_schema_composer import AgentSchemaComposer
        from haive.agents.react.agent import ReactAgent
        from haive.agents.simple.agent import SimpleAgent

        # Create agents with their engines
        react_agent = ReactAgent(name="Calculator", engine=calc_engine)
        simple_agent = SimpleAgent(name="Planner", engine=plan_engine)

        # Compose schema from agents
        MultiAgentState = AgentSchemaComposer.from_agents(
            agents=[react_agent, simple_agent],
            name="MultiAgentState",
            separation="smart",  # Intelligent field separation
            build_mode=BuildMode.SEQUENCE  # Sequential execution
        )

        # Create state instance
        state = MultiAgentState()
        # state.messages will use preserve_messages_reducer automatically

Attributes:
    logger: Module-level logger for debugging schema composition
    BuildMode: Enum defining execution patterns for multi-agent systems

Note:
    This module uses a custom message reducer (preserve_messages_reducer) instead
    of LangGraph's default to prevent loss of fields like tool_call_id in
    ToolMessage objects during multi-agent execution.

        """Apply intelligent field separation based on usage patterns.

        Smart separation automatically determines whether fields should be
        shared or namespaced based on:
        - Number of agents using the field
        - Special field names (e.g., "messages", "shared_*")
        - Field type and purpose

        Args:
            composer: SchemaComposer instance to add fields to
            all_fields: Dictionary of collected fields from all agents
            agents: List of agent instances for context

        Separation Rules:
            - Fields used by multiple agents → shared
            - Fields named "messages" or "meta_state" → always shared
            - Fields prefixed with "shared_" → always shared
            - Fields used by all agents → shared
            - Single-agent fields → namespaced if multiple agents exist

        Example:
            If agent1 and agent2 both have a "context" field, it becomes shared.
            If only agent1 has "tool_results", it becomes "agent1_tool_results"
            in a multi-agent setup.
