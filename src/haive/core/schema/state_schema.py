"""State schema base class for the Haive framework.

from typing import Any
This module provides the StateSchema base class that extends Pydantic's BaseModel
with features specifically designed for AI agent state management and graph-based
workflows. The StateSchema class adds powerful capabilities including field sharing
between parent and child graphs, reducer functions for state updates, engine I/O
tracking, and extensive serialization support.

StateSchema serves as the foundation of the Haive Schema System, enabling fully
dynamic and serializable state schemas that can be composed, modified, and extended
at runtime. This flexibility makes it ideal for complex agent architectures and
nested workflows.

Key features include:
- Field sharing: Share state between parent and child graphs with explicit control
- Reducer functions: Define how field values should be combined during state updates
- Engine I/O tracking: Map which fields are inputs and outputs for specific engines
- Message handling: Built-in methods for working with message fields
- Serialization: Comprehensive support for converting to/from dictionaries and JSON
- State manipulation: Methods for updating, merging, and comparing states
- Pretty printing: Rich visualization of state content
- Engine integration: Prepare inputs and process outputs for specific engines

Example:
    ```python
    from typing import List
    from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage
    from pydantic import Field
    from haive.core.schema import StateSchema
    from langgraph.graph import add_messages

    class ConversationState(StateSchema):
        messages: List[BaseMessage] = Field(default_factory=list)
        query: str = Field(default="")
        response: str = Field(default="")
        context: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)

        # Define which fields should be shared with parent graphs
        __shared_fields__ = ["messages"]

        # Define reducer functions for each field
        __reducer_fields__ = {
            "messages": add_messages,
            "context": lambda a, b: (a or []) + (b or [])
        }

        # Define which fields are inputs/outputs for which engines
        __engine_io_mappings__ = {
            "retriever": {
                "inputs": ["query"],
                "outputs": ["context"]
            },
            "llm": {
                "inputs": ["query", "context", "messages"],
                "outputs": ["response"]
            }

    """Enhanced base class for state schemas in the Haive framework.

    StateSchema extends Pydantic's BaseModel with features for AI agent state management
    and graph-based workflows. It serves as the core component of the Haive Schema System,
    providing extensive capabilities for state management in complex agent architectures.

    Key Features:
        - Field sharing: Control which fields are shared between parent and child graphs
        - Reducer functions: Define how field values are combined during state updates
        - Engine I/O tracking: Map which fields are inputs/outputs for which engines
        - Message handling: Methods for working with conversation message fields
        - Serialization: Convert states to/from dictionaries and JSON
        - State manipulation: Update, merge, compare, and diff state objects
        - Integration: Support for LangGraph and engine components
        - Visualization: Rich display options for state inspection

    Special Class Variables:
        __shared_fields__ (List[str]): Fields to share with parent graphs
        __serializable_reducers__ (Dict[str, str]): Serializable reducer function names
        __engine_io_mappings__ (Dict[str, Dict[str, List[str]]]): Engine I/O mappings
        __input_fields__ (Dict[str, List[str]]): Input fields for each engine
        __output_fields__ (Dict[str, List[str]]): Output fields for each engine
        __structured_models__ (Dict[str, str]): Paths to structured output models
        __structured_model_fields__ (Dict[str, List[str]]): Fields for structured models
        __reducer_fields__ (Dict[str, Callable]): Runtime reducer functions (not stored)

    Field sharing enables parent and child graphs to maintain synchronized state for
    specific fields, which is critical for nested graph execution. Reducer functions
    define how field values are combined during updates, enabling sophisticated state
    merging operations beyond simple assignment.

    Example:
        ```python
        from typing import List
        from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage
        from pydantic import Field
        from haive.core.schema import StateSchema
