"""Core types for the Haive graph system.

This module defines fundamental types, protocols, and enums used throughout
the graph system, providing a strong typing foundation for graph components.

The system is built on several key concepts:
1. Protocols: Define structural interfaces (like NamedEntity)
2. Type aliases: Simplify complex type combinations
3. Enums: Define constants for node/edge types and states
4. Policies: Define configuration objects like RetryPolicy

These types ensure consistency and type safety across the system while
enabling IDE auto-completion and static type checking.
