"""General type definitions for common domains.

This module provides pre-defined type definitions for common domains like
file types and programming languages. These types are used throughout the
Haive framework for validation, categorization, and processing logic.

The general types module includes comprehensive lists of file extensions,
programming languages, and other domain-specific categories that are
frequently needed in document processing, code analysis, and AI workflows.

Key Components:
    FileTypes: Comprehensive file type definitions and extensions
    ProgrammingLanguages: Programming language definitions and metadata

Examples:
    File type validation::

        from haive.core.types.general import FileTypes

        # Check if file is a supported document type
        if file_ext in FileTypes.DOCUMENTS:
            process_document(file_path)
        elif file_ext in FileTypes.CODE:
            analyze_code(file_path)

    Programming language detection::

        from haive.core.types.general import ProgrammingLanguages

        # Get language info by extension
        lang_info = ProgrammingLanguages.get_by_extension(".py")
        print(f"Language: {lang_info.name}")
        print(f"Type: {lang_info.type}")
