"""Timestamp mixin for tracking creation and modification times.

This module provides a mixin for adding timestamp tracking to Pydantic models.
It automatically records creation time and provides methods for updating and
querying timestamps, which is useful for auditing, caching, and expiration logic.

Usage:
            from pydantic import BaseModel
            from haive.core.common.mixins.general import TimestampMixin

            class Document(TimestampMixin, BaseModel):
                title: str
                content: str

            # Create a document (timestamps automatically set)
            doc = Document(title="Example", content="Content")

            # Check how old the document is
            age = doc.age_in_seconds()

            # Update document and its timestamp
            doc.content = "Updated content"
            doc.update_timestamp()

            # Check time since last update
            time_since_update = doc.time_since_update()
