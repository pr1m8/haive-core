"""Serialization mixin for enhanced data conversion capabilities.

This module provides a mixin for adding enhanced serialization and
deserialization capabilities to Pydantic models. It offers methods for
converting models to dictionaries and JSON strings, and for creating models
from dictionaries and JSON strings.

Usage:
    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    from haive.core.common.mixins.general import SerializationMixin

    class User(SerializationMixin, BaseModel):
        id: str
        name: str
        age: int
        _private_data: str = "hidden"

    # Create a user
    user = User(id="123", name="Alice", age=30)

    # Serialize to dict (excludes _private_data by default)
    user_dict = user.to_dict()

    # Serialize to JSON with indentation
    user_json = user.to_json(indent=2)

    # Deserialize from dict
    new_user = User.from_dict(user_dict)

    # Deserialize from JSON
    new_user = User.from_json(user_json)
    ```
