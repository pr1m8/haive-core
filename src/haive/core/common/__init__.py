"""Haive Core Common Module.

This module provides common utilities, models, types, and mixins used throughout the Haive
framework. It contains foundational components that enable consistent behavior across
different parts of the system.

Key Components:
    - Mixins: Reusable component behaviors through mixin classes
    - Models: Common data structures and models
    - Types: Type definitions and protocol interfaces
    - Structures: Collection structures with enhanced functionality
    - Logging: Centralized logging configuration

Typical usage example:
            from haive.core.common.mixins import IdentifierMixin, TimestampMixin
            from haive.core.common.types import JsonType, DictStrAny
            from haive.core.common.logging_config import configure_logging

            # Use mixins in your class
            class MyComponent(IdentifierMixin, TimestampMixin):
                def __init__(self, name: str):
                    super().__init__()
                    self.name = name

            # Configure logging
            configure_logging(level="INFO")
