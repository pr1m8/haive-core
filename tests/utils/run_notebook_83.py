**Query Analysis Dimensions:**

1. **Clarity**: Is the query clear and unambiguous?
2. **Specificity**: Is the query specific enough to retrieve relevant documents?
3. **Scope**: Is the query scope appropriate (not too broad or narrow)?
4. **Terminology**: Does the query use appropriate domain-specific terms?
5. **Intent**: Is the user's intent clearly expressed?
6. **Context**: Is sufficient context provided for understanding?

**Refinement Strategies:**

- **Add Specificity**: Include specific terms, entities, timeframes, or constraints
- **Clarify Intent**: Make the desired outcome or answer type explicit
- **Expand Context**: Add background information that helps with retrieval
- **Use Better Terminology**: Replace colloquial terms with domain-specific language
- **Break Down Complex Queries**: Split multi-part questions into focused sub-queries
- **Add Constraints**: Include relevant filters or limitations

**Query Types to Consider:**
- Factual (seeking specific facts)
- Analytical (requiring analysis or comparison)
- Procedural (asking for step-by-step guidance)
- Conceptual (understanding abstract ideas)
- Temporal (time-based information)
- Causal (cause-and-effect relationships)
