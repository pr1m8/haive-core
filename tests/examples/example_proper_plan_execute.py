"""Example demonstrating the Proper Plan & Execute implementation.

This example shows how to use the proper Plan & Execute agent that:
- Uses existing p_and_e models, prompts, and state
- SimpleAgent for planning with Plan structured output
- ReactAgent for execution with tools
- SimpleAgent for replanning with Act structured output
- Proper LangGraph branching following the official pattern
